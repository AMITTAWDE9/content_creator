# SAMPLE PROJECT CREATION GUIDELINE 


We will be taking the example of the project  “LEGO COLLECTOR’S DILEMMA(LINEAR REGRESSION)” to demonstrate what parameters we will be evaluating in the sample project. Ideally your sample project should follow the following pointers so that the team can evaluate its fitness for consumption:

_ORIGINAL IDEA:_ There should be no plagiarized content in the project which is taken directly from online notebooks/blogs.
 
_INTRODUCTION:_ The introduction part of the sample project should contain the following subheadings:
- Problem Statement: Statements explaining briefly the problem being  
                                                 solved in the project

- About the Dataset: Statements explaining briefly what the dataset being 
                                              used is

- Why solve the project: Statements highlighting what DS skills are  
                                                 being explored in the project

_OUTLINE WITH DESCRIPTION:_ Divide the project into logical tasks.
For each task in the project, write a short description mentioning what to do in the task (Refer to sample notebook for clarity) . For minimum of two tasks, provide the code associated with it.

Follow the folder structure to make the sample project. The 3 folders are 

- data: Put the data that you will use in the exercises here.
- images: Put the images that you will put inside the content here.
- notebook: Put the jupyter notebook containing the content here and name it `notebook.ipynb`
