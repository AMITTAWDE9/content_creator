# SAMPLE CONTENT CREATION GUIDELINE 


We will be taking the example of the concept “LINEAR REGRESSION” to demonstrate what parameters we will be evaluating the sample content. Ideally your sample content should follow the following pointers so that the team can evaluate its fitness for consumption:

_ORIGINAL CONTENT:_ There should be no plagiarized content in the topic which are taken directly from books/blogs. You can take a portion of the topic for explaining giving due credits; but not for explaining the entire topic.

_MOTIVATION:_ There should be enough motivation (through relevant examples or real-world use cases) before beginning a particular topic. Learners should be excited to start his journey and this is the main goal for motivation. For ex: “Why linear regression is used to solve this problem?” 

_INTUITION:_ Often there is a lack of intuition while explaining things from a mathematical point of view. Intuition bridges this gap perfectly and is of prime importance during onboarding a particular topic. For ex: “What does it mean when we say best-fit line in linear regression?” You are welcome to take the help of any sort of visualization/text to demonstrate intuition. But do not redirect learners to external links (they can expire). 

_CODE SNIPPETS:_ Python code must be there both as learning tasks and during explanation of topic. It is a must have component in the sample content. If you feel that the learner will experience difficulty in grasping the meaning of the code, explain what the lines of code are actually performing line by line. For ex: “How to train a linear regression model with scikit-learn?” will involve around 3-4 lines of code and we expect you to explain at least the “.fit()” and “.predict()” methods.

_MATHEMATICS (optional):_ This is not a compulsory component as we do not expect you to make a sample chapter where there is mathematics involved. However, we do recommend you taking up one such chapter as it will help solidify your capability to onboard things mathematically. For ex: “How to determine the coefficients of the best fit line with the OLS method?” If you are discussing algorithms , make sure to incorporate its pseudocode.

Follow the folder structure to make the sample concept. The 3 folders are 

- data: Put the data that you will use in the exercises here.
- images: Put the images that you will put inside the content here.
- notebook: Put the jupyter notebook containing the content here and name it `notebook.ipynb`
